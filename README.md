## I. Overnight Strategy:
   This is a basic strategy which involves buying a security after the close of a market and selling before the opening on next day. 
   There are several researches which have tried to prove the Overnight strategy to be better than Day Strategy demonstrating the Day and Night Effect [1][2].
   It has huge scope of improvement by incorporating other trading strategies like [momentum trading](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/introduction-to-momentum-trading/)
